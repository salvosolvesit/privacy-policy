Privacy Policy for So Hangry

Effective Date: [Insert Date]

Thank you for using So Hangry! We understand the importance of privacy and want you to feel safe when using our app. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information. Spoiler alert: we don’t collect any personal information from you!

1. Information We Don’t Collect
At So Hangry, we are committed to keeping things simple. We do not collect any personally identifiable information, including but not limited to:

Your name
Email address
Phone number
Payment information
In fact, you don’t even need to create an account or sign in to use our app. The only thing we care about is making sure you’re never hangry again!

2. Usage Data (Anonymous)
We do collect anonymous data to help us improve the app, but this data cannot be traced back to you. This includes:

General app usage (how often you use the app)
Features you interact with (e.g., meal suggestions, grocery list, notifications)
Device type and operating system to ensure compatibility and a smooth experience
But, don’t worry, this data is not tied to your identity. It's like we know you’re using the app, but we don’t know who you are. Sneaky, right?

3. Location Data (Optional)
To recommend nearby restaurants or suggest local meal options, we may ask for access to your location. However, this is completely optional and you can choose to disable location services at any time in your phone settings. We won’t stalk you—we just want to help you find food quickly when the hangry strikes!

4. Third-Party Services
We don’t use third-party analytics tools or track your behavior across the internet. We also don’t share or sell any data with third parties. We are the anti-hangry zone, not the data-hungry zone.

5. Notifications
So Hangry may send you notifications about your meal plan, hangry tips, or to remind you to take a deep breath before getting too hungry. You can always disable notifications in the app settings if you’d rather not receive them.

6. Children’s Privacy
Our app is intended for adults who are looking to prevent hangriness. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13. If we find out that we have inadvertently collected information from a child, we will take steps to delete it.

7. Data Security
While we don’t collect any personal information, we still take precautions to ensure the security of the app and its features. However, as with any app, no method of data transmission over the internet is 100% secure, so please use the app at your own discretion.

8. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We might update this Privacy Policy from time to time (hopefully for the better). When we make updates, we will change the Effective Date at the top of this page. Keep an eye on it, but we promise, we’ll never surprise you with something scary.
